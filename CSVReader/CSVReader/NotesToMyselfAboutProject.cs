        solve as if it's my own problem I want to solve.
        Read from csv file.  create list from each line.  each file is a list of lines.
        search by keyword and return the contents of entire line where the keyword is.

        what do I know?  
            1.  
            2.  file reader will read each line as one long string, including all the commas.
            
            4.  each item becomes it's own string.
            5.  implement string.split, but ignore commas within items? (wait on this until I know I can separate
                between items)
            6.  add each new string after split to the a new list.
            7.  iterate through list to find keyword.
            8.  start with one line, one list.  find keyword.
            9.  display line(list) with keyword.
            9.  add another line, another list.  create list containing both lists.
            10. double iterate through both lists to find keyword.
            11. display line(list) containing keyword.
